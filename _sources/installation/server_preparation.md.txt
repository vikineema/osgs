# Preparing the server

## Basic Security

### Unattended upgrades

This will automatically install only security fixes on a continual basis on your server.

```
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
```

### ssh

Disable password authentication for SSH

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set this:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
Then do
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

### Crowdsec

https://crowdsec.net/ 


```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crowdsec
```

### Fail2ban

```
sudo apt install fail2ban
```
See: https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page 



### Firewall

```
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

Should show something like this:

```
Status: active

To             Action   From
--             ------   ----
22/tcp           ALLOW    Anywhere         
22/tcp (v6)        ALLOW    Anywhere (v6)
```

We will open more ports as they are needed.

### Status monitoring

gotop is a great console based dashboard for monitoring your server.

Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install golang
cd 
go install github.com/cjbassi/gotop@latest
chmod +x go/bin/gotop
sudo cp go/bin/gotop /usr/local/bin/
```

Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install golang
cd 
go get github.com/cjbassi/gotop
chmod +x go/bin/gotop
sudo cp go/bin/gotop /usr/local/bin/
```


Now just type gotop whenever you want to see your terminal system monitor.



## Additional Software

### Docker

```
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
```

<div class="admonition warning">
At this time we do not use the snapd installation of docker. Note that if you do,
you will need to install osgs in your home directory. See snapd docker notes 
for details.
</div>


### Git, rpl, pwgen, Make and openssl

Needed for checking out our docker project and running the various make
commands we provide.

```
sudo apt install git make rpl pwgen openssl apache2-utils
```

or fedora:
```
sudo dnf install openssl rpl git pwgen
```

## Firewall

If you are using ufw, open port 80 and 443 as minimum. After the initial setup, you
can again close port 80.

```
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

### Move on to OSGS Installation

Ok we are ready to install OSGS! Go ahead to the [initial configuration page](initial_configuration.md) now.
