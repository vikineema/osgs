# OSGS Architecture

The [Open Source GIS Stack
(OSGS)](https://kartoza.github.io/osgs/introduction.html) is a platform based
on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which is a container deployment
environment. Containers are isolated application runtimes. They typically
contain a minimal version of an operating system, typically Linux. In that
minimal version of the operating system the containers will typically have one
single task they are responsible for doing, for example running PostGIS or
running Geoserver and so on. Each container has a very specific task and the
design intent that you do not deploy mutliple services in a single container.
You must deploy each service in its own container then orcherstrate those
containers together. This is all managed using Docker and Docker Compose which
is the orchestration environment for Docker. OSGS is simply a set of Docker
orchestration routines to bring up different services in different containers,
make them all talk together and present them as one cohesive architecture.

The other important thing that OSGS does, is it provides some scripts to do
various management commands and tasks, for example, bringing up services or
down services, copying data, making backups, etc. These scripts are provided
using a utility called "make" which is typically used by programmers to compile
software, but can also be used to automate tasks. There is a Makefile which
does all the high level tasks on the orchestrated architecture that OSGS
provides.

The services published in OSGS are independent from the Open Source GIS Stack
project and any issues encountered using these applications should be raised
with the appropriate upstream project.

**Note**: Anybody can take open source software and package it as Docker services.
Therefore, when you are choosing which Docker service and containers to run, you can
go and have a look at the various ways different people have packaged up a particular
software and find one that works the best for you.
