# Why OSGS

## Why the OSGS was built

There's usually more than one way to bake a cake.

Open Source ecosystems are complex, and whilst they are capable of facilitating the
development and support of incredible value, it is not without it's caveats.

In some cases, new users can be overwhelmed by the sheer number of projects and
options available, raising the barrier for entry and preventing growth.

The Open Source GIS Stack is simply an opinionated implementation of a set of
open source utilities which has been carefully crafted by industry experts to
provide a simple and integrated platform for the development of geospatial-first
applications and systems without having the need for users to install and configure
disparate systems individually.

The goal of the project is to select key components from the open source ecosystem,
wire them up together in a way that is easy to use and maintain, and provide a series
of sample end-to-end solutions which can act as a launchpad or scaffold for new projects.

OSGS decides on the best application for a task and gives users an opportunity to emulate or
extend the activity without having to jump through hoops or worry about system configuration.

By remaining open source and utilizing open source components, OSGS is able to provide
a platform that is extensible, and can easily integrate with other new or legacy systems.
Experienced solution architects can also easily swap out various components for various use cases.

OSGS is Geospatial Open Source that just works.
