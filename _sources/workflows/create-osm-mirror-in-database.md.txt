# Creating an Open Street Map mirror into your database

The OSM mirror service uses the kartoza/docker-osm tool to create an in-database mirror of a designated geographical area in the designated postgres database schema (set to: osm). The OSM mirror tool is described in the project README [here](https://github.com/kartoza/docker-osm):

## Preparing the Country PBF file and the clip area document

The PBF files for the country or region of interest can be downloaded from [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). The PBF file used in this workflow was for Kenya and the URL for the country PBF file is https://download.geofabrik.de/africa/kenya-latest.osm.pbf.

The clip area constrains any data being imported into the PostGIS database to a specific geographic area. You will need to save the clip area document as `conf/osm_conf/clip.geojson`. For best performance, a simple rectangle is best, but any complex polygon can be used. The `clip.geojson` can also be the same extent of the administrative area for your country or region specified in the PBF file, or it can be a smaller extent. The CRS of the geojson should always be `EPSG:4326`. [<sup>1</sup>][1]

You can easily create such a clip document at  https://geojson.io or by using QGIS. For this workflow the clip area document for the country Kenya, was obtained using QGIS. The Kenya country boundary data was obtained from the [Kenya- Subnational Administrative Boundaries data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ken-administrative-boundaries).


## Editing the mappings.yml  file. 

For advanced users, you can tweak the `conf/osm_conf/mapping.yml` file to customize the OSM data being imported into the PostGIS database. 

You can see how the imposm3 mapping syntax works [here](https://imposm.org/docs/imposm3/latest/mapping.html)

> **Note**: Any alterations to the `conf/osm_conf/mappings.yml` file while the OSM mirror service is running will not change the current OSM data in the database. To effect these changes, you will need to clear the imported OSM data in the database (and stopping the OSM mirror service), using `make stop-osm-mirror` and deploying the OSM mirror service, using `make deploy-osm-mirror`.

## Deploying the OSM mirror service

### Deploy the initial stack

In your server terminal, deploy the initial stack by running either `make configure-ssl-self-signed` or `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl`. The initial stack consists of the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services.

Use `make configure-ssl-self-signed` if you are going to use a self-signed certificate on a localhost for testing. Use `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl` if you are going to use a Let's Encrypt signed certificate on a name host for production. The `make configure-ssl-self-signed` will deploy the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services, but after running `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl` you will need to run `make deploy-hugo` to deploy the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services.

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Initial Stack](../img/pg-service-1.png)

### Deploy the PostgreSQL and PostGIS service

Deploy the PostgreSQL and  PostGIS service using `make deploy-postgres`. If you already have PostgreSQL installed on your local machine, ensure that you specify a different port number for the Postgis Public Port other than port 5432, the default port for PostgreSQL. For example, you can use the port number 5434.

![Postgis Public Port](../img/pg-service-2.png)

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/pg-service-3.png)

The PostgreSQL and PostGIS service has the following databases:

![PostgreSQL and PostGIS Service Databases](../img/pg-service-4.png)

In this workflow, you will be connecting to the `gis` database.

### Deploy the OSM mirror service

Deploy the OSM mirror service using `make deploy-osm-mirror` and follow the subsequent prompts. Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-13.png)

You can view the logs for the OSM mirror service using the command `make osm-mirror-logs`.

## Editing your local connection service file

On your local machine (where you have QGIS Desktop installed), the per-user connection service file can be at `~/.pg_service.conf` or the location specified by the environment variable `PGSERVICEFILE`. Add a service to this connection service file with the following service name and connection parameters.

```
[osgs]
dbname=gis
user=docker
port=<POSTGRES_PUBLIC_PORT>
password=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>
host=
sslmode=require
``` 

For the port and password connection parameters, use the `POSTGRES_PUBLIC_PORT` and  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` specified in the `.env` file. For the host connection parameter, use the hostname of the server where you have set up OSGS.

For more information on the PostgreSQL connection service file see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html).

## Setting up your PostGIS connection in QGIS

QGIS Desktop can be downloaded from [here](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and installed using [these instructions](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html).

On your local machine, open QGIS Desktop.  In your Browser Panel,  right click on the PostGIS option and click on "New Connection". This will open the Create a New PostGIS Connection dialogue.

![New PostGIS connection](../img/pg-service-5.png)

In the Connection Information section, give the connection an appropriate name. For the service, enter the service name that you specified in the [connection service file](#editing-your-local-connection-service-file). Set the SSL mode to `require` and ensure you have enabled the `Also list tables with no geometry` and the `Allow saving/loading QGIS projects in database` options. Once all the configuration options have been set, click on "Test Connection". Once you see the `Connection to <Name> was successful` message, click "OK". You have now successfully connected to the PostgreSQL and PostGIS service `gis` database.

## Loading the default OSM mirror QGIS project

To load the default OSM mirror QGIS project, in the ```qgis_projects``` table, in the ```public``` schema, double click on the ```osm_mirror_qgis_project```. The project layers will load onto the QGIS **Map View**.

!["Load the Default QGIS Project"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-11.png)

!["View the Default QGIS Project"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-12.png)

## Loading the OSM Mirror Layers into QGIS

The imported Open Street Map layers for the clip area specified are present in the `osm` schema of the database. 

!["OSM Mirror Layers"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-3.png)

To load a layer from the `osm` schema onto the QGIS Map View, double click on the table or drag and drop the table onto the Map View. 

!["Load a OSM Mirror Layer"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-4.png)

## Saving a QGIS project into the PostGIS database

In the **Menu Toolbar** click on **Project**. From the drop down menu select **Save To** **PostgreSQL**.

!["Save QGIS Project in Database"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-5.png)

Save the project in the `public` schema and name the project. In this example we have named the project `qgis_projects`.

!["Save QGIS Project in Database"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-6.png)

## Backing up and restoring a QGIS project into the database

To back up the QGIS project created in the previous section, run the command `make backup-db-qgis-project`. This backs up the `qgis_projects` table in the `public` schema as a `.sql` file named `qgis-projects.sql` in the `/backups/` folder. The `backup-db-qgis-project` target also creates a copy of the `qgis-projects.sql` file with the date the backup was made in the file name e.g. `qgis-projects-2022-02-08.sql`

To restore the last back up of the QGIS projects in the `qgis_projects` table, run the command `make restore-db-qgis-project`. To restore an older backup, first copy it to `/backups/qgis-projects.sql` then run the command `make restore-db-qgis-project`.

## Saving QGIS layer styles into the database

To save the style of a layer into the database, right click on the layer in the **Layers Panel** and select **Properties**. 

!["Save Default Layer Style to Database"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-7.png)

In the Symbology section of the Layer Properties, click on **Style** > **Save style**. 

!["Save Default Layer Style to Database"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-8.png)

In the Save Layer Style dialogue select **In Database (postgres)** and name the style file. You can add an optional description of the style and also set the style to be the default style for the layer.  

!["Save Default Layer Style to Database"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-9.png)

The saved style is added as an entry in the `layer_styles` table in the `public` schema of the PostGIS OSM database. 

!["Default Layer Styles in Database"](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-10.png)

## Backing up and restoring the QGIS styles into the database

To back up the QGIS styles created in the previous section, run the command `make backup-db-qgis-styles`. This backs up the `layer_styles` table in the `public` schema as a `.sql` file named `qgis-styles.sql` in the `/backups/` folder. The `backup-db-qgis-styles` target also creates a copy of the `qgis-styles.sql` file with the date the backup was made in the file name e.g. `qgis-styles-2022-02-08.sql`

To restore the last back up of the `layer_styles` table, run the command `make restore-db-qgis-styles`. To restore an older backup, first copy it to `/backups/qgis-styles.sql` then run the command `restore-db-qgis-styles`.

## Publishing with GeoServer

To publish the OSM mirror layers in the `osm` schema using GeoServer, use the [Publishing layers using Geoserver](https://kartoza.github.io/osgs/workflows/publishing-layers-using-geoserver.html) workflow.

## Publishing with QGIS Server

To publish the OSM mirror layers in the `osm` schema using QGIS Server or to publish a QGIS project that references the OSM mirror layers in the `osm` schema, use the [Publishing a QGIS project using a connection service file](https://kartoza.github.io/osgs/workflows/publishing-qgis-project.html) workflow.
