# Set up process for pg notify - TODO

Pg notify is a notification system that Postgres has that can let a client know
that a change has occurred in the database. This workflow will demonstrate how
to: 

* Register the notification function.
* Push out the message to a client (we will start with QGIS as the client)
* Have QGIS automatically update and refresh the canvas when a notification happens
