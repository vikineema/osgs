# Publishing layers using GeoServer

In this workflow, you will publish the `osm_waterways_rivers` OpenStreetMap layer in the `osm` schema of the Postgres service `gis` database.

## Deploying the OSM Mirror service

### Prepare the Country PBF file and the clip area document

The PBF files for the country or region of interest can be obtained from [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). The PBF file used in this workflow was for South Korea and the URL is https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/south-korea-latest.osm.pbf.

The clip area constrains any data being imported into the PostGIS database to a specific geographic area. You will need to save the clip area document as `conf/osm_conf/clip.geojson`. For best performance, a simple rectangle is best, but any complex polygon can be used. The CRS of the geojson should always be `EPSG:4326`.

You can easily create such a clip document at  https://geojson.io or by using QGIS. For this workflow the clip area document for Seoul, South Korea, was downloaded from the [southkorea/seoul-maps](https://github.com/southkorea/seoul-maps/blob/master/juso/2015/json/seoul_municipalities_geo_simple.json) repository.

### Deploy the initial stack

In your server terminal, deploy the initial stack by running either `make configure-ssl-self-signed` or `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl`. The initial stack consists of the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services.

Use `make configure-ssl-self-signed` if you are going to use a self-signed certificate on a localhost for testing. Use `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl` if you are going to use a Let's Encrypt signed certificate on a name host for production. The `make configure-ssl-self-signed` will deploy the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services, but after running `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl` you will need to run `make deploy-hugo` to deploy the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services.

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

### Deploy the PostgreSQL and PostGIS service

Deploy the PostgreSQL and  PostGIS service using `make deploy-postgres`. If you already have PostgreSQL installed on your local machine, ensure that you specify a different port number for the Postgis Public Port other than port 5432, the default port for PostgreSQL. For example, you can use the port number 5434.

![Postgis Public Port](../img/pg-service-2.png)

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/pg-service-3.png)

To view the PostgreSQL and PostGIS service databases, create a psql shell in the `gis` database using `make db-psql-shell` then use the meta command `\l` to list all the databases.

### Deploy the OSM mirror service

Deploy the OSM mirror service using `make deploy-osm-mirror` and follow the subsequent prompts. Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-13.png)

You can view the logs for the OSM mirror service using the command `make osm-mirror-logs`.

## Deploying the GeoServer service

Deploy the GeoServer service using `make deploy-geoserver`. The service is now accessible on `/geoserver/` e.g. `https://localhost/geoserver/`. Use the `<GEOSERVER_ADMIN_USER>` and `<GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD>` specified in the `.env` file to sign into GeoServer. 

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/publish-using-geoserver-12.png)

You can view the logs for the GeoServer service using `make geoserver-logs`.  

## Publishing Layers with GeoServer

### Create a new workspace

After signing in, there will be 3 options on the Welcome webpage: "Add layers", "Add stores", or "Create workspaces". Click on "Create Workspaces".

![Add Workspace](../img/publish-using-geoserver-1.png)

Name the new workspace `osm-mirror`. For the Namespace URI, use the format `https://<server>/geoserver/osm-mirror/` with the server parameter being the hostname of the server where you set up OSGS.

![Define Workspace](../img/publish-using-geoserver-2.png)

Check/uncheck checkboxes in the Security tab to set data access rules at the workspace level as required.

![New Workspace Security](../img/publish-using-geoserver-3.png)

Once you are done defining your new workspace, click "Save".

### Create a new data store

Return to the Welcome page and click on the plus icon with "Add store" next to it.

![Add store](../img/publish-using-geoserver-4.png)

In the Vector Data Sources category, select "PostGIS - PostGIS Database".

![Select Vector Data Source Category](../img/publish-using-geoserver-5.png)

In GeoServer, every PostGIS store must be connected with just one schema. In this workflow, you will publish the `osm_waterways_rivers` layer which is in the `osm` schema hence you will create a vector data store in the `osm-mirror` workspace connected to the `osm` schema.

Name your new vector data source `gis-osm`. For the connection parameters, specify the following:

```
host : db
port : 5432
database : gis
schema : osm
user : <POSTGRES_USER>
passwd : <POSTGRES_PASSWORD>
```

The `<POSTGRES_USER>` and `<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>` are specified in the `.env` file.

Also, be sure to scroll down and set the SSL mode to `REQUIRE` then click on "SAVE".

![SSL Mode Required](../img/geoserver-osm-5.png)

From the list of layers in the New Layer page, search for the `osm_waterways_rivers` layer using the search bar and click on "Publish".

![Publish Rivers Layer](../img/publish-using-geoserver-7.png)

Complete the layer details as appropriate and make sure to click the options highlighted in red in the image below. Click on "Save" once you are finished.

## Using QGIS Desktop as a web service client for GeoServer published layers

You can connect to GeoServer from QGIS using WFS or WMS using the scheme: `https://<server>/geoserver/<workspace>/wfs` or `https://<server>/geoserver/<workspace>/wms` where `<server>` is the hostname of the server where you set up OSGS and `<workspace>` is the name of the workspace you created in the previous [section](#create-a-new-workspace).

In your QGIS Desktop Browser Panel, right click on the WMS/WMTS option and click on New Connection.

![New WMS Connection](../img/publish-using-geoserver-9.png)

Give the connection an appropriate name and set the URL using the WMS schema as shown below. Click on "OK".

![New WMS Connection Details](../img/publish-using-geoserver-10.png)

You can drag and drop the layer onto the Map View, to view the layer.
