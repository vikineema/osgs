# Publishing a QGIS project using a connection service file

This workflow will demonstrate how to publish a QGIS project where the layers are inside of a PostgreSQL database. This involves uploading a QGIS project file through the pg_service file for authentication then publishing the map. The project used in this workflow is the OSM Mirror QGIS project, `osm_mirror_qgis_project`, in the `public` schema of the Postgres service `gis` database.

## Deploying the OSM Mirror service

### Prepare the Country PBF file and the clip area document

The PBF files for the country or region of interest can be obtained from [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). The PBF file used in this workflow was for South Korea and the URL is https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/south-korea-latest.osm.pbf.

The clip area constrains any data being imported into the PostGIS database to a specific geographic area. You will need to save the clip area document as `conf/osm_conf/clip.geojson`. For best performance, a simple rectangle is best, but any complex polygon can be used. The CRS of the geojson should always be `EPSG:4326`.

You can easily create such a clip document at  https://geojson.io or by using QGIS. For this workflow the clip area document for Seoul, South Korea, was downloaded from the [southkorea/seoul-maps](https://github.com/southkorea/seoul-maps/blob/master/juso/2015/json/seoul_municipalities_geo_simple.json) repository.

### Deploy the initial stack

In your server terminal, deploy the initial stack by running either `make configure-ssl-self-signed` or `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl`. The initial stack consists of the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services.

Use `make configure-ssl-self-signed` if you are going to use a self-signed certificate on a localhost for testing. Use `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl` if you are going to use a Let's Encrypt signed certificate on a name host for production. The `make configure-ssl-self-signed` will deploy the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services, but after running `make configure-letsencrypt-ssl` you will need to run `make deploy-hugo` to deploy the Nginx, Hugo Watcher and Watchtower services.

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

### Deploy the PostgreSQL and PostGIS service

Deploy the PostgreSQL and  PostGIS service using `make deploy-postgres`. If you already have PostgreSQL installed on your local machine, ensure that you specify a different port number for the Postgis Public Port other than port 5432, the default port for PostgreSQL. For example, you can use the port number 5434.

Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

To view the PostgreSQL and PostGIS service databases, create a psql shell in the `gis` database using `make db-psql-shell` then use the meta command `\l` to list all the databases.

### Deploy the OSM mirror service

Deploy the OSM mirror service using `make deploy-osm-mirror` and follow the subsequent prompts. Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/osm-mirror-workflow-13.png)

You can view the logs for the OSM mirror service using the command `make osm-mirror-logs`.

## Deploying QGIS Server

To deploy the QGIS Server service, run `make deploy-qgis-server`. Use `make ps` to view the services running. The following services should be up:

![Services Up](../img/publish-using-pgservice-file-4.png)

You can view the logs for the QGIS Server service using `make qgis-server-logs`.

### Creating the server-side connection service file

To create the server-side connection service file, run the command `cp conf/pg_conf/pg_service.conf.example conf/pg_conf/pg_service.conf` in the terminal. In the `conf/pg_conf/pg_service.conf` file, add a service with the following service name and connection parameters.

```
[osgs]
dbname=gis
user=docker
port=<POSTGRES_PRIVATE_PORT>
password=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>
host=db
sslmode=require
```

For the port and password connection parameters, use the `POSTGRES_PRIVATE_PORT` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` specified in the `.env` file. For the host connection parameter specify the hostname as `db`.

## Editing the `qgis-server.conf` file

Edit the `conf/nginx_conf/locations/qgis-server.conf` file by replacing the default PostgreSQL connection string `postgresql://?service=nginx&sslmode=disable&schema=public&project=smallholding` in the `location /qgis-pg/` section of the file with the PostgreSQL connection string `postgresql:?service=osgs&sslmode=require&dbname=&schema=public&project=osm_mirror_qgis_project` and save the changes.

Restart the QGIS Server service using `make restart-qgis-server`.

## Using QGIS Desktop as a web service client for QGIS Server published layers

In your QGIS Desktop Browser panel, right click on the `WMS/WMTS` option and create a new connection.

![New WMS Connection Details](../img/upload-qgis-project-3.png)

Give the new connection an appropriate name. For the URL parameter, access the published QGIS project via `/map/` i.e. `https://<server name>/map/`. The `<server name>` parameter is the hostname of the server where you set up OSGS. Click "OK".

![New WMS Connection](../img/publish-using-pgservice-file-2.png)

Once the connection is successful, you can now load into QGIS the entire OSM Mirror QGIS project or individual layers from the project as WMS layers. Drag and drop the `OSM Mirror` layer onto the Map View to view the project.
